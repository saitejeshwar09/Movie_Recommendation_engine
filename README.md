# Movie Recommendation Engine

The movie recommendation engine is a system that uses algorithms and data analysis to suggest films to users based on their preferences and viewing history. These systems are designed to learn about a user's taste in movies over time and make personalized recommendations based on this information. By leveraging large datasets and complex mathematical models, recommendation engines can provide a more tailored and enjoyable viewing experience for users. 

## Datasets

The movie recommendation engine uses the following datasets from the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset available on Kaggle:

- [Movies Dataset (movies.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv)
- [Credits Dataset (credits.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- Recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering)
